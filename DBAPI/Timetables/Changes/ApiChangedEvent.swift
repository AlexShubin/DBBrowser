    ///             Note that these two events do not have to belong to the same stop.
    ///             For example, removing the last stop of a trip will result in arrival cancellation
    ///             for the last stop and of departure cancellation for the stop before the last.
    ///             So asymmetric cancellations of just arrival or departure for a stop can occur.
